Only walking down the streets of Ingbridge is advertisement enough of his services to his less than savoury clientele, and a warning to any honest merchants who plan on making the crossing. Often paid by clients on the brink of bankruptcy to rob their ships to spur on dubious insurance claims, Branley seems to remain a necessary evil to many of the elite. Disappearing amongst the sail high waves when pursued by the King’s navy, he has avoided capture thus far through his cunning, charisma, and most importantly of all, his ruthlessness.",
